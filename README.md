# Scroll-With-Different-Input
An easy way to scroll with different inputs (gamepad, keyboard) rather then the mouse scrollwheel

## How to use it in your own project:

- Step 1: - Follow the comments inside the script for a better understanding of the code 
- Step 2: - Create a new TextMeshPro Dropdown
          - Add the script to the gameobject (Dropdown -> Template) 
          - Reference the scroll rect, viewport rect transform and content rect transform
- Step 3: - You're done
